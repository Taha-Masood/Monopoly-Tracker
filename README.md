# Monopoly-Tracker

Monopoly tracker uses statistical analysis of all player's within a game of monopoly to determine the optimal next move for a player. Produced in C++ utilizing the QT application framework for the graphical user interface. Graphically displays board settings for user interactions, and considers all possible moves for the current player, including, property purchase, trade offers, building, chance/community-chest, placement and financial standing of opposing players'.

### Current Status

- Currently within the testing/debugging stage as all required base functions have been implemented.
- Qt application includes three input methods and distinctively displays move rating using a progress bar.
- Backend components require edge-case testing, and confirmation of correct inputs to make the application more user-friendly.
- Currently, the file is adapted to function utilizing standard input/output to allow for faster debugging.
- To compile entire application download the Qt project files, and redirect output/input from Monopoly_Tracker.cc.
